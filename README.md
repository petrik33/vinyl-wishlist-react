# TIERS

## My First Complete React App

Check it out via this link: https://petrik33.github.io/vinyl-wishlist-react/

This Web App lets you create and edit the tier-list
of your (currently mine) favourite musical albums.

It was inspired by my vinyl wish-list and huge love
of music in general.

Functionality:

* Accesible Drag and Drop
* Albums List View
* Modal Description for each Record

In Progress:

* Musical API Integration
* Session Storage
* View Filtering and Sorting
* Better List Editing
* Detailed Album Descriptions

Technologies used:

* React
* Typescript
* Immer
* React-Beautiful-DnD
